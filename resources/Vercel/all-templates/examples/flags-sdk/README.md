# Flags SDK

The [Flags SDK](https://flags-sdk.dev/) is a free, open-source library for using feature flags in Next.js and SvelteKit.

Examples in this folder use the Flags SDK combined with different flag and experimentation providers to implement an ecommerce example application.

Examples are further set up to integrate with [Flags Explorer](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/feature-flags/using-vercel-toolbar), which allows overridding feature flags and experiments for the current session.

### Template

The starting point for these provider specific examples is maintained [in the Flags SDK repository](https://github.com/vercel/flags/tree/main/examples/shirt-shop).
